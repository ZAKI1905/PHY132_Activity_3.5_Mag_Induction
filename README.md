# PHY 132 – Activity 3.5 - Magnetic Induction Answer Checker

This repository contains a Streamlit application for PHY 132 Activity 3.5 on Magnetic Induction. The app is designed to help students check their final numerical answers to problems related to magnetic induction, electromagnetic induction, and associated topics. In addition, it provides comprehensive background information on key concepts such as magnetic field formulas, Faraday's Law, magnetic flux, Lenz's Law, centripetal force, Ohm's Law, power dissipation in resistors, and gravitational force and potential energy.

## Overview

The application is divided into two main pages:

- **Answer Checker:**  
  Select a question from a dropdown, input your numerical answer(s), and receive immediate feedback if your answer is within a 1% tolerance of the expected value.

- **Background Information:**  
  Detailed explanations and centered formulas for:
  - Magnetic field configurations (long straight wire, circular loop, and solenoid),
  - Electromagnetic induction (including Faraday’s Law, magnetic flux, and Lenz’s Law),
  - Centripetal force,
  - Ohm's Law and power dissipation in resistors,
  - Gravitational force and gravitational potential energy (using $g \approx 9.81\,\text{m/s}^2$).

  The background information also includes diagrams and images that illustrate these concepts. For example, the magnetic flux diagram uses color-coded descriptions (green arrows, salmon-colored areas, red normals).

## Features

- **Interactive Answer Checker:**  
  Verify your numerical answers with a 1% tolerance limit.

- **Comprehensive Background Material:**  
  In-depth explanations and formulas to support your learning in magnetic induction and electromagnetism.

- **Easy Navigation:**  
  Use the sidebar to switch between the Answer Checker and Background Information pages.
